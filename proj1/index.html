<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<!-- <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p> -->
<p>In this project, I implemented elements of a basic rasterizer, which is able to display svg files.
    In particular, I incrementally increased the complexity of drawing triangles. First, I rasterized triangles by 
    coloring points found to be inside its bounds. This was then extended with supersampling, allowing for smoother 
    transitions along high frequency edges. After a small detour in implementing transformation matrices, I allowed 
    for triangles with color gradients using barycentric coordinates. Finally, I rasterized triangles that drew from 
    a reference texture, with different methods of selecting which texture pixel to display as well as determining 
    what level of detail to employ.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

    <p> In order to rasterize a triangle with given endpoints, I first rearranged the line testing equations from lecture 
    into the form Ax + By + C >= 0 for each edge, and calculated those constants for the triangle. I then determined which 
    pixels to test for: I chose to test all points within the bounding box of the triangle (min x, min y) to (max x, max y) 
    for simplicity (which is indeed no worse than itself). Additionally, I also checked to make sure that the bounding box 
    did not exceed the boundaries of the screen, either with a value less than zero or greater than the width/height. I then 
    looped through the pixels of this bounding box and calculated the three line equations for each pixel; if they were all 
    the same, I would fill the pixel in with the triangle's color. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

    <p>For supersampling, I modified the existing sample buffer so that for all of the places where it was created, 
    resized, or cleared, it would be of size (width * height * sample_rate). Originally, I had attempted to group 
    samples in a square (such that the samples for a single pixel would be in sqrt(sample_rate) rows and sqrt(sample_rate)
    columns), as it was slightly more visually intuitive and I had already started sampling in that way. However, as I was
    encountering multiple horizontal copies of the image that I could not resolve, I switched to sample_rate copies for each
    pixel instead, which did resolve the issue. To determine where to sample, for each pixel, I would instead perform the 
    line calculations for samples at 1/(sqrt(rate)) intervals in a grid, and color the sample buffer accordingly. To get to
    the actual display in resolve_to_framebuffer, I summed up all of the colors for each sample in a pixel and divided by
    the total number to get an average, which is displayed. This provides partial coloring to pixels along the edges of color
    transitions, providing a smoother appearance. </p>

    <div align="middle">

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>For higher supersampling rates, the larger number of samples more accurately reflects the true fraction of each pixel
          that is of each color. By averaging the color values for each sample, the pixel might now represent details that were not
          previously shown in fewer samples, and provide a smoother representation of edge transitions. In these corners, the jagged
          edges were produced by coloring full pixels based on whether their centers were in the triangle; with more samples, pixels
          partially in the triangle will get some coloring, while pixels with parts outside will appear lighter, providing an overall
          smoother gradient.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>

    <p>This part was relatively simple, as I only returned the three transformation matrices (and converted to radians!), and spent 
    the majority of my time shifting red boxes around slightly until they looked acceptable.</p>

    <figcaption align="middle">Barycentric coordinates represent how much of each vertex coordinate a given point within the triangle
    consists of, and sum to 1. The sum of each barycentric coordinate multiplied by the value of its corresponding vertex returns the location of the
    original point. In the above image, the color of each pixel is a weighted sum of red, green, and blue based on its barycentric coordinates.
    At the vertices, the colors are pure, as they can be represented with exactly that vertex. Along the edges, a point can be represented
    as a sum of two vertices, such as green and blue on the top right side. Closer to the top, a point would be more green and have a higher
    value in the green vertex coordinate. At the exact center, all three vertices have equal weight (coordinates 1/3, 1/3, 1/3) and the color 
    is grayish.</figcaption>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

    <p>Pixel sampling involves taking a point on a triangle to be rasterized and attempting to determine its color value based
    on a corresponding location on a reference texture. To rasterize a triangle with a texture, we are given the vertices of the 
    triangle itself, the vertices of its corresponding triangle on the texture, and the texture itself. To color each point on 
    our rasterized triangle, we first find its barycentric coordinates, then look up the color on the relevant texture level with
    the corresponding coordinates on the texture triangle. Pixel sampling methods differ in determining what exactly is the correct
    color value to return: nearest simply returns the color value of the nearest texel (we round the texture cartesian coordinate), 
    while bilinear returns a weighted average of the four adjacent texels, based on how close they are (we take the floor and ceiling
    of x and y texel coordinates, then perform linear interpolations to get the color value, with additional bounds for extreme values).</p>


    <div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part5_n1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest, 1 sample.</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part5_n16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest, 16 samples.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part5_b1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear, 1 sample.</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part5_b16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear, 16 samples.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

    <p>These is not a significant difference between sampling level, with most noticable differences along the edges of the image
    (smoother borders for 16). Between nearest and bilinear sampling, nearest tends to be sharper and blockier, and is more liekly
    to miss fine detail, such as the white grid lines. Using the color of the closest texel might miss out on possible sharp differences
    in color in adjacent nearby texels, which would not be accounted for. In comparison, bilinear sampling is smoother, and shows
    fine changes to a greater extent, though not necessarily crispness, due to its averaging, similarly to supersampling.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

    <p>Level sampling involves determining what level (what level of detail) of the texture to sample from. To implement this, I 
    additionally stored the barycentric coordinates of the pixels 1 unit down and right of the sample pixel and mapped it onto the
    texture, then calculated its level. This represents the approximate area of the texture and the level of detail needed for that
    region; a larger area covered means that only coarse detail is needed, and a higher level map could be used. A smaller area covered
    means that adjacent pixels and fine detail is necessary, requiring a lower level. Nearest level sampling simply chooses the color of 
    the nearest (rounded) level, while bilinear performs a weighted sum over the colors returned from the two closest levels similar 
    to that for pixels. </p>

    <p>Supersampling requires more memory to store a larger sample buffer, and requires a corresponding decrease in speed, as all
    computations must be repeated for each sample. Supersampling does allow for smoother images, which is espeicially visible along sharp
    borders of lower detail textures. Bilinear pixel sampling requires more computations than nearest, but not much more memory, and leads
    to a smoother transition between textured pixels. Bilinear level sampling again requires increased computations and slower speed, but
    no significant memory, while smoothing the transition between detail levels compared to nearest level sampling.</p>
