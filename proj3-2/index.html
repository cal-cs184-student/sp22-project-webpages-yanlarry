<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<!-- <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p> -->
<p>In this project, I updated a ray-tracing renderer with additional features. I allowed for the use of additional bsdf types with
	reflection and refraction, which could depict more complex light pathing. Additionally, I modified camera sampling to simulate
	a thin lens, which could be adjusted to create a rendered image focusing on different areas and with varied depth of field.

	  </div>
	  <br>

		<p> 0 bounces: only the light source emits light directly to the camera without any bounces.</p>
		<p> 1 bounce: the walls and floor are illuminated by the light, and can bounce light to the camera. The spheres themselves
			only show reflections of the light source, as light can only bounce off of the sphere surface in one specific direction,
			and only those that happen to reflect onto the light source can be lit in one bounce. The right sphere has some variance
			in its relection due to the random inclusion of the refraction component (still black due to more bounces required).</p>
		<p> 2 bounces: the ceiling is now illuminated due to light bounces off of the other surfaces. The mirror sphere is able
			to reflect light from the walls and floor to the camera. The glass ball is still black, as it takes one bounce from 
			the light source to the wall, one to go into the sphere, and one to go out of the sphere to the camera. If there was a
			light source behind the sphere, it would be visible now. There is also a small reflection on the right sphere from the light source
			reflection on the left sphere.
		</p>
		<p> 3 bounces: the glass sphere is now visible (4 rays: light source to wall, wall into sphere, across sphere, out of sphere, making 3 bounces). The reflection sphere now shows the ceiling. The light that refracted
			through the glass sphere to hit the floor (2 bounces) is now visible (one more bounce to the camera).
		</p>
		<p> 4 bounces: the reflection sphere now shows the refraction sphere as not black. In general the reflection 
			sphere shows what is visible one bounce ago (as reflecting takes one bounce). Another beam of refracted light, this time
			from the reflection in the mirror sphere, is visible on the right wall. There is also some additional reflection off of
			the bottom of the glass sphere due to the concentrated light off of the floor underneath it.
		</p>
		<p> 5 and 100 bounces: no major visible changes noticed, more fine details could exist between the mirror sphere's reflection
			and the glass sphere, but it does not seem detectable.
		</p>



<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field</h3>

    <p>In a pinhole camera model, each image location only receives light along a single ray: there is only one possible line 
		along which light can travel from the pinhole to that location. This means that it perfectly captures the exact light
		from outside without any blurring. In a thin lens model, a given image location can receive light from anywhere on the
		lens, which could reflect light from slightly different locations. Depending on the distance between image sensor and
		lens, different locations would be in focus, while areas outside would be blurred, as their ideal focal point would be
		either in front of or behind the sensor.

	  <p> Aperatures (left, 4.8): While the pinhole shows the full scene with perfect clarity, the corners of the room and extremities
		  of the dragon become slightly blurred for 0.10. There becomes significant blurring of the head and some on the tail for 0.30,
		  and by 0.50, the front and back of the room are highly blurred, and only the central segment of the dragon is in focus.
	  </p>
	  <p> Depths (right, 0.30): At 4.6, the head of the dragon is in focus; at 4.8, the central regions are in focus, with some blurring at
		  the head and tail; at 5.0, the head is blurred and the back is in focus; and at 5.2, only the very back is somewhat in focus,
		  with everything else blurred.
